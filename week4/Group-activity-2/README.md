## Task: Random photo gallery!

> You can use the files in `./src` folder as a starter.

In this practice, you will create and remove HTML elements from the HTML document.

## Instructions

You are given an HTML file, **./src/index.html** with some interactive buttons on the HTML page. These buttons should trigger the page to display or remove
images from the page.
Right now, the buttons will not do anything when clicked.

Your job is to fill in the code in the given script file, **./src/.js** to cause images to be added and removed from the HTML page when these buttons are clicked.

Some code will be written for you, so all you'll need to do is fill in code where indicated. An example image element along with CSS styles is provided to serve as a guide for you.
